# Introduction

This repository implement all kinds of identification algorithm of causal inference, including causal graph with hidden common causes. 

1. ID and IDC algorithm of Ilya Shpitser and Judea Pearl. This algorithm is complete for Directed Acyclic Graph with hidden common causes. 

Warning: Identification results of Ilya's algorithm are not unique due to different topological orderings and different fixing functions! You should notice that before you use it.

In future, we will add more automatic identification algorithms!
